# gameTracker
a project that tracks all your game activity on PSN.

The game tracker will track the games the user is currently playing, has played or will play. It will consist of a server API and a client API based on REST API. The server API will process requests from the client API with data into a database. For now, the data will be stored in .csv format but it will be replaced with SQL database later. The server API will be written in Python. It will gather meta data of each from Wikipedia by using its [API](https://api.wikimedia.org/wiki/Getting_started_with_Wikimedia_APIs). The data of playing games will be retrived by using [PSN API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/psn-api).

**_NOTE:_** The PSN API is provided as [a Node module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/psn-api). There is one, [a Python moudle](https://pypi.org/project/PSNAWP/), which is not official since it's generated by reverse engineering. Simplycity-wise, it would be better to use a single language, Pyhton but for the future, it should be considered using the Node module.
